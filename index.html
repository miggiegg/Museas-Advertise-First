		<div>1. Relevant 
Sponsored content must be relevant to our platform and audience. Advertisements must be related to art, culture, food, entertainment, or similar subjects. Examples include museums, atractions, tours, gift shops, and other local establishments. 

2. Appealing 
Sponsored content must be designed with polish and professionalism in mind. These advertisements should be work of arts themselves, fit to stand alongside other beautiful exhibits and artwork. Museas can help design your sponsored content to ensure a high-quality level is achieved.

3. Unobtrusive No tracking, pop-ups, or auto-playing video ads are allowed. Sponsored content are presented as static “cards”. Some sponsored content may be interactive for an enhanced experience, with close collaboration with Museas. Review our Advertising Policy for more information.
</div>
		<div>With videos, photo galleries, and even AR/VR, some ads can be further designed to draw in additonal attention.

		<div>Beautiful

</div>
		<div>Let’s face it – most users hate advertisements. Ads are getting more pervasive, obnoxious, and intrusive. On computers and smartphones, adblockers are increasingly being installed to bypass advertisements. 

As a solution to this challenge, Museas has developed a strategy that aims to undue this negative perception. Our approach is to collaborate with sponsors to create advertisements that users will enjoy, without being obtrusive or irrelevant and still pass through ad filters.
